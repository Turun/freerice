a script for freerice.com

this is a script that loads "http://freerice.com", logs in, selects the math questions and starts solving those. For every correct answer the website donates 10 grains of rice. The rice is financed by the ads on the site.

make sure to let the browser start without doing anything else. after that you can minimize it and the program will run in the background

requires your computer to be able to run python (with the 3-party selenium module) and a browser with a driver. e.g. geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.16.1) for Firefox
